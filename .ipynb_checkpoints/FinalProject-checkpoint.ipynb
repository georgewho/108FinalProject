    "The NBA has been experiencing a transition from a half court pacing to running and spreading the floor by using more shooters in lineups. We want to investigate whether or not there has been a statistically significant change in the average height and weight of lineups/players in the NBA over the years (transition to small-ball, a strategy modern NBA teams employ to run faster paced plays with better ball movement). We then want to explore if there is actually a correlation between the height and weight of NBA players and their shooting percentages (in terms of 3-pointers and free throws) in order to investigate whether or not bigger players are changing their playstyles. Furthermore, we want to explore the change in the strategies employed by NBA teams based on where they shoot the ball and the value of the shots taken.\n",

    "Has the NBA started incorporating more small-ball related strategies over the past few decades? Our group wants to find out if there has been a recent meta shift in the NBA towards using small-ball strategies. According to Wikipedia, small-ball is defined as “a style of play that sacrifices height, physical strength and low post offense/defense in favor of a lineup of smaller players for speed, agility and increased scoring (often from the three-point line).” We'll use various visualizations to see how the NBA meta has changed in terms of height, weight, 3-point percentages, and other factors.\n"

    "The above article is a study done regarding the evolution of the 3 point shot over time. As the data indicates, not only is there a greater number of 3 point shots taken, but there is also a proportionally greater number of 3 point shots when compared to 2 point shots. In fact, while the number of 2 point shots taken have been stagnant for the last 40 years, it seems that the number of 3 point shots taken have always increased every 5 years. Furthermore, there seems to be extreme outliers in terms of players in regards to the 3 point shot, as it can be seen from that data that players like Steph Curry and James Harden are shooting more 3 pointers than ever before in history. The above factors seem to indicate that there is indeed a greater emphasis in spreading the floor when compared to before, as there is a greater need for players to get adequate room to shoot from afar. Furthermore, it would seem to indicate that smaller players who are better shooters do seem to be favored in the modern NBA court, as they seem to be becoming the focus of the team’s offense when compared to prior eras.\n",

    "This article describes the small-ball phenomenon as it attempts to find statistically significant data that supports the claim that NBA teams have shifted their strategy to fit around the meta changes of smaller players. The data shows that while the NBA has drastically increased the height and weight of players since the 1960’s, in recent years, the weighted weight of the league has dropped nearly 5 pounds. While the article did not find any statistically significant data regarding lighter or shorter teams winning a higher number of games, it is undeniable that most star players such as Kevin Durant, Chris Bosh and Kevin Love are much skinnier than previous renditions of the role. Furthermore, the data shows that lighter teams have produced a faster playstyle, and using their natural athletic abilities, new superstars are able to out run and out pace heavier teams.\n"

Our aim is to not hold any team as “worse” than any other team, unless the numbers say so otherwise. This means our team doesn’t need to ask players for their data or do any “spying” on players. Our end goal is to highlight whether small-ball strategy is effective or not, and not to bash on any other strategy that a player/team may employ. No offence will be given or issued from our data analysis. The purpose of this project is purely for educational use, and will not benefit any third party outside of school boundaries.\n",

    "Our data source will be obtained from Kaggle and https://www.basketball-reference.com/;  we assume that all the data collected is unbiased since basketball-reference.com simply tracks the numbers that occurred during a match and aggregates this data into other statistics, like 3 pt %. We suspect no harm of bias in this data because there shouldn’t be any emotional attachments to it (eg. no one is placing bets on these data and affecting the NBA players themselves). Our Kaggle dataset also comes from Omri Goldstein, a top data scientist from Israel who has participated in many data science competitions and is a leader in the data sciences. He has competed in numerous data science competitions and we trust that the judges in all of these competitions have vetted him for data biases. Kaggle is also a source for high quality datasets that many data scientists use to find sources of data. Furthermore, as the numbers we’ll be using are empirical data such as the player’s height, weight, etc., we don’t believe there is generally a room for error or emotional biases within our datasets. However, there are cases such as Kevin Durant, whose real height is supposedly much taller than his recorded height, so that could cause room for error even in the empirical data we’re tracking.\n",

    "Through this research, we simply hope to verify the existence of small-ball strategies and whether even big centers are forced to spread the floor by being able to shoot 3 point shots. Therefore, we don’t believe that there will be any negative consequences to our research and unbiasedly hope to confirm or deny people’s belief in small-ball strategies over time. Lastly, we don’t believe that there will be any hugely impactful unintended consequences because we’re focusing on an idea that’s already present in most people’s minds, but not verified through hard data.\n"
